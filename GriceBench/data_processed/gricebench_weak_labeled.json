What do you think about Scotland putting a lot in place to protect the Loch Ness monster? Do you think that means he might exist LOL [agent_1]: Haha that is strange. It definitely makes one wonder...maybe the loch ness is some super secret scientific experiment or military weapon?

    "context": "[agent_2]: When you turn 100 in japan, the PM gives you a silver cup to celebrate. Too many people are turning 100 so that they had to find a way to make cheaper cups. Maybe give the cup when people turn 200? [agent_1]: That would be one way to cut the costs. How many people are turning 100 that it is costing enough to have to find a cheaper solution? Talk about a healthy society.  [agent_2]: Yeah. Celebrating a centennial is cool, but the gov't can't afford it! Are you a fan of Johnny Depp?",
