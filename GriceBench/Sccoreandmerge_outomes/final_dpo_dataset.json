    "chosen": "Sure, let's clarify this. When we talk about smoking near computers, it can indeed clog filters and cause issues with the cooling systems. The biohazard part is less about the smoke itself and more about the buildup of tar and nicotine, which can attract mold and other harmful microorganisms, especially if the computer isn't cleaned regularly. This buildup can create a significant risk, not just for the computer but for anyone handling it due to potential health hazards. So while the warranty might be valid, the biohazard warning emphasizes the importance of maintaining cleanliness around electronics.",

As for the idea of a \"biohazard,\" it might seem far-fetched, but in a broader sense, smoking near electronics can create a dangerous environment where the risk of fire increases significantly due to the presence of burning materials and sparks.
